# My personal `dotfiles`
Inside these dotfiles you will be able to find the following setup:
* general setup for unix utilities including `mc`, `htop`, `wget`, `less` and more,
* `vim` and its plugins,
* `vscode` and its plugins,
* `fzf` and additional settings,
* `zsh`, including `oh-my-zsh` plus plugins,
